who# For Freedoms notes
- All art is political.

## Podcast
- A podcast series that looks at a wide range of living, practicing artists and discusses the non-obvious ways that their work has a political dimensiion; look at their work through a political dimension
- Radio Free Corcoran.
- Music faculty program radio shows, playlists relevant to courses along with discussion of how the selections feed into the studies? what kind of licensing is required?
- is there a budget to set up a decent podcast studio that can host 4-5 participants?
- can podacast studio extend to non 4F content? (Fidays at Five, sound art showcases, etc?)
- can we enlist Alma Laprida to help spec/build podcast studio?

## Other
- how do we open up programming such that either there are stipends for content creators, or there's almost zero effort on their part?
- can toolkit be Open Source? A GitHub repo? is it a collection of documents?
- interactive activity/event for a town hall dinner: design billboard, project and loop; possibly a public thing with Robin Bell? (I'd love to do something with Barbara Kruger!)

## Tech
- timeline/calendar of exhibitions and events? is there a tool online that can act as a virtual war room? (a collaborative space for tracking project/event needs like Monday or Notion)
- working back from that, deadlines?
- for each, tech needs? (specifically on the Corcoran side, I'm assuming NGA will handle its own events/exhibitions)
