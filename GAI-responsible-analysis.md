*Do we have a set of use cases that describes how students, faculty and staff will use GenAI?*

*What typical tasks do staff use AI for?*

*What typical tasks do students use AI for?*

*What typical tasks do faculty use AI for?*

*What are the risks associated with those tasks? How do we mitigate or eliminate the tasks? Which tasks do we prohibit AI?*

*what would training look like?*

*"Businesses and organizations using generative AI tools may inadvertently give away trade secrets or waive confidentiality in commercially sensitive information if such information is used for training or prompting AI tools. They should consider putting in place a combination of technical, legal, and practical safeguards to prevent this."*

*"Implement a staff policy and provide training on the risks of including confidential information in prompts."*

*"Businesses and organizations should
consider mitigating the risk by using IP compliant tools, seeking
indemnities where possible, vetting datasets, and implementing
technical and practical measures to reduce the likelihood
of infringement."*

*"Consider keeping records documenting how an AI model was trained."*

*"Advise against prompts referencing third-party business names, trademarks, copyright works, or specific authors/artists."*

*Do we have a strategy for analyzing and selecting off-the-shelf AI tools before we implement for research and pedagogy?*

*Which tools' models violate IP law?*

*Can we be sued for publishing output generated by tools that did not ethically source the training data?*

*How has GW IT vetted the AI tools and services it is deploying? For the Corcoran, which needs more specialized tools, how can we begin to evaluate before we request a tool? For research projects that use more experimental tools, what guidelines should we follow, particularly if we start building our own tools?*

*"In cases where there is a legitimate business reason to synthesize someoneâ€™s voice or likeness, obtain necessary consent and licensing from the subject." - for example: voice clones for people with disabilities.*

+ Pre-GenAI: is the model IP compliant? will my prompt be stored? who owns the outpu?
+ Generation: is my prompt running afoul of IP? is my prompt revelealing sensitive info?
+ Post-generation: validate, redact, transform
