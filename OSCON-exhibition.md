## Blurb
**Public Sauce**
Recent works by Jason Bulluck, Chris Combs, Michelle Lisa Herman, David Mordini, Derek Toomes.
Exhibition dates: March 17 - April 4

Public Sauce presents a variety of artworks whose creation is dependent upon open source tools. From full-features standalone apps like Blender, to libraries like React, to the low-level code that controls hardware IO, open source opens up a vast new range of possibilities for artists, both formally and conceptually. The wide adoption of OS in the creative community provides a counterbalance to the commercialization of both technology and of art, and a celebration of the intellectual commons.

## Wall labels
For each artwork, james needs at least one repo to link to...

### loose crap

- to do: line up gallery sitters
- to do: see if there's budget for for food/drink
- to do: collect artist bios (Chris Combs, Michelle Herman, Jason Bulluck, others TBD.) Short, 3 - 5 sentences.
- to do: each artist provide links to repos used in the pieces in the show (will add to wall text)
- blurb about exhibition 5 sentences (James H will draft.)
- images of works for web
- [Smith 102 Floorplan](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18609417/Smith.102.pdf)
- Artists: what gear needed: Mac Minis? Flat screens? Projectors?

**Possible titles**

I am assuming some things about all the works in the show:
- the works use open source code borrowed from others to create new works (solving hardware IO needs, generating content algorithmically)
- you are not using code you've built and have shared publically
- the artworks are not open source or creative commons licensed
- the subject of the work is not a critique of open source
- Where I'm wrong about these assumptions, let me know

General question for studio visit:
do you see the code you are using as a quick, efficient solution to a problem, or as something to explore and be in conversation with? if the latter, describe.

From an idea from @Combs:
- URL to repo(s) associated with works to add to wall labels (possibly as QR codes.) Perhaps wall text also includes a short, high-level description of where the borrowed code enables the greater work.

Each piece of code is like a new color in the palette, expanding the range of expressiveness avaiable to creative coders.



Starting in the mid-twentieth century and continuing to the present, a rought parallel between artistic practice and software engineering, A counterbalance to the commercialization of code and of art.

Open Source software emerged as cultural counterbalance to the fencing in of knowlege. Prior to the emergence of 'home computers' software developers recognized the value of sharing code, (no need to re-invent wheels, extra eyes on bugs, civic vitues.)

re-inventing the flat tire. Why solve a problem that had already been solved?

In some respects open source could be seen in parallel to conceptual art

works that draw from open source libraries

borrowed

built on the kindness of others
an intellectual commons such that one doesn't need to re-invent the flat tire, rather conserve one's attention and invest it in building something new using available building blocks.

Are you guys using open source in different ways? (hardware IO, generating content algorithmically)
do the artists in the exhibition feel differently about OS?
do they borrow for mere utility, or is there a conversation with the borrowed code? are the artists using the code in ways that the author never conceived or intended?
do the artists see the code they are using as a quick, efficient solution to a problem, or as something to explore and be in conversation with?

variety of works that borrow open source code to solve different technical problems across media.

There are more things to learn and make than there is time available. Open resources allow artists to explore capabilities
allow artists to try out new ideas without having to build everything from scratch.
allow artists' imaginations to cover wider ground than they could on their own.
it's easier to imagine more possibilities knowing that one doesn't have to start from scratch.

I'm looking for the widest range of uses of OS, but right now I see two main categories:
- HARDWARE: controlling output devices/physical computing/droids that paint
- ORACLES: algorithms for generating content
Is my thinking too narrow? Other categories?

Chris Combs - processing data and controlling devices
Michelle Lisa Herman - train a system that generates texts similar to tropes of artists interviews
Jason Bulluck - React platform for mobile apps
Derek Toomes -
David Mordini - Blender, open source CAD apllication,
